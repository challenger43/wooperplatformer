full revamp of platformer: (aka my excuse for why i haven't updated in 1/2 year bc ive been brainstorming(read: super busy))

new game concept:
    instead of merely collecting all the stars, need to collect stars against my ai/npc thingie and bring them back to your "charge thing" to charge that up
    once that's charged then your portal will spawn. 

    Combat system:
    idk if ill actually make this or anything but basically quagsire can shoot mud balls. if ai/you gets hit by one then if its holding a star it will
    drop the star(and the star will disappear off into the distance to prevent an infinite loop of getting shot), vice versa for you but the AI has a pretty
    sick gun. 

    there will likely not be enough stars for both of you to survive 

new graphics:
    better background pictures in general
    variants of platforms and stuff based off "biome" 
    more sprite animations

Stuff to add:
    guns, bullets, charge anchors(with multiple anims/textures for each "level" of charge (but wait what if there's too many levels....))
    difficulties? e.g. peaceful = no gun violence
    drop star/ pick up star function
    charge function(when you have a star)

Stuff needed (for me):
    a "developer" mode: (slap in a password and get this stuff)
        ability to toggle camera from character / npc
        bypass guns
        infinite gun reloading
        the infamous "q" key to speedrun
        flight
        aka cheats
    npc ai system:
        have a general idea of max jump height / distance travellable to do math and stuff 
        while starsRemaining != 0
            searchForStar()
            collectStar()
            bringStarHome()
        searchForStar (within grumpig's camera range / sight){
            go through stars + see if any are in range, in range = in array of "stars viewed
            if in range solve distance for each, shortest distance = star to collect
        }
        collectStar:
            star collected = false
            stepsMade = []
            if star is in jumping range + no platforms obstructing it: case 1
                go to star.x and jump. set starcollected = true
                bringStarHome or pass or continue or whatever its called
            else if star is in jumping range but platform obstructing it: case 2 
                walk to the "end" of platform, jump until you pass that platform's highest y value (or those platforms idk how imma make it do parkour cause i suck)
                then swap x until you are on the platform. walk until star collected. then go bring it back
            else if star is not in jumping range and there are platforms to parkour to it: case 3
                jump to nearest jumpable platform (see step one of case 2) 
                scan to see how much further: if needs to make it to another platform, jump to the next platform
                    maybe spawn clones to see exactly which jump sequence needed using arrays, whichever one successfully triggers physics.overlap to called
                    function is the correct array, so then grumpig will execute each step of that array and collect the star 
        bringStarHome():
            go through stepsMade and retrace steps ig?
            useStar():
                aka another function i gotta write
        then repeat this whole thing

        useStar: 
            if holdingStar && overlapping with chargeAnchor (or maybe just the purple light rays/general halo): 
                star.disable body
                chargeanchor value += starValue
        dropStar:
            if holdingstar:
                don't be holding star(it might bounce a lil tho)
        carryStar
            not really a function but basically set speed + jump height a lot lower. also you can't shoot guns while you're holding a star
    better management (i.e. do i need to make more js files with each level as one bc index.js is kinda chonky rn)
