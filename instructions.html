    <h1 id="woopIntro">This is our little blue hero, Sooper the Wooper: <img id= "wooperPic" src = "assets/smile-wooper.png" alt="Sooper the Wooper"> </h1>
         <p id="woopDescription">Sooper's got one goal: visit his Paldean relatives. Unfortunately, Sooper's idea of “planning” involves forgetting half the details.
         He remembers something about needing Woop-Balls... but that's about it. Along the way, he keeps getting distracted 
        and totally forgets why he’s on this trip in the first place. He’ll need to collect enough Woop Balls to turn into Quagsire 
          (because apparently, that’s important). And...that's about it. Hopefully(read: 1% chance) he'll somehow make it to Paldea!</p>
